/// Project helpers are functions that simplify the way you define your project.
/// Share code to create targets, settings, dependencies,
/// Create your own conventions, e.g: a func that makes sure all shared targets are "static frameworks"
/// See https://docs.tuist.io/guides/helpers/

extension Project {
    // Extract any helper functions into this file.
    // All the definitions here can then be used in Project.swift manifest file
